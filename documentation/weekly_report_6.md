## What has been achieved this week?

I wrote the code for multi AI, CLI and Tries. They all work as they should and the program now has the functionality described in the specification document.

## What have I learned?

Nothing major. However I have a Zoom-meeting with an instructor on Monday about tries and I'm hopeful I will learn a lot from that.

## Problems encountered

Various bugs, but nothing major.

## What's next?

Polishing the project, writing some documentation, tests and rewriting some of the code to use tries instead of a list.
