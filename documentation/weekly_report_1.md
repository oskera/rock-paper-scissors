# Weekly Report 1

## Hours spent

6 hours in total. Breakdown below:

| Amount | Description                 |
| ------ | --------------------------- |
| 4      | Reading about Markov chains |
| 2      | Writing documentation       |

## What has been achieved this week?

A good foundation has been laid for the project.

## What have I learned?

Basic knowledge of how Markov chains work.

## Problems encountered

Defining the scope of the project. The AI using Markov chains feels narrow. Maybe it could be expanded to include [rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock](https://adams.osu.edu/sites/adams/files/imce/4-H/STEM_Camp/Rock%20Paper%20Scissors%20Lizard%20Spock.pdf) or another variation, such as [rock-paper-scissors+](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/1805.08195) as well? This wouldn't affect the complexity of the algorithm itself though. Another possibility is adding a database, so the algorithm can use data from older games as well. The problem with this is that this course is about algorithms and not databases.

## What's next?

Creating the basic structure of the program; basic application logic for the rock-paper-scissors game and a CLI. Possibly a rudimentary algorithm for the AI.
