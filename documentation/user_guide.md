# User Guide

## Requirements

This project uses Python 3.10 or newer. The project has no non-developer dependencies.

## Running

After cloning the project it can be run by running the following command:

```
python src/rps.py
```

This command opens a CLI, that asks for your action. You have three possible actions: R, P, S. These symbolize the rock, paper and scissors in the standard rock-paper-scissors game. After typing your action you can see the action the AI chose before you wrote your action. The program keeps count of the score and the rounds played. The project also has a demo version, which shows the action AI chose before you type your own action. It can be run by running the following command:

```
python src/demo.py
```
