# Weekly Report 3

Been sick for past two weeks, trying to update the project in near future.

## Hours spent

11 hours in total. Breakdown below:

| Amount | Description                                     |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 3      | Reading material                                |
| 2      | Reading about Markov chains and data structures |
| 2      | Initializing project                            |
| 4      | Writing game logic                              |

## What has been achieved this week?

I initialized the project and wrote a module that handles the game logic.

## What have I learned?

I learned a lot about Markov chains. The original [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06769.pdf) about using Markov chains in RPS doesn't seem to consider the outcome of the game.

## Problems encountered

I was sick for past two weeks so progress has been slow. The choice of data structure is still open, I will start with a list. trying to imitate the AI in the paper I was inspired by. I might experiment with other data structures later to see if there is difference in performance.

## What's next?

I will write the code for implementing Markov chains and a simple CLI.
